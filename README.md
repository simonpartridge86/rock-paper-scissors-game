# Rock-Paper-Scissors Games

This repo contains two Rock-Paper-Scissors games made in Weeks 1 & 2 of my [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp (Apr/May 2022).

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: Original Version

In Week 1 of School of Code, we learned JavaScript basics, including using **variables, functions, if statements, loops, and objects/arrays**. This knowledge was put to the test in a one-day hackathon, with the aim to build a Rock-Paper-Scissors game that functioned through alerts and prompts.

As bonus challenges, I extended the game to include 'lizard' and 'spock' move options, continuous play, game and score counters, move validation, username validation, and a cheating computer player.

This game can be played by opening the corresponding 'index.html' file in a browser.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: DOM Version

In Week 2 of School of Code, we learned about **HTML DOM manipulation** using JS, and were challenged to refactor the original Rock-Paper-Scissors game to operate in the browser through DOM updates rather than alerts and prompts.

This game can be played by opening the corresponding 'index.html' file in a browser.
